## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why Cancellations Happen:
1. **No Financial Penalty:** Zero deposit requirement makes cancellation cost-free
2. **Long Planning Windows:** 40+ day lead times reduce commitment
3. **Agent Incentive Misalignment:** Commission structure doesn't penalize cancellations
4. **Business Travel Flexibility:** Corporate bookings have inherent uncertainty

### Why Channels Differ:
1. **Direct vs Indirect:** Web users show higher intent and ownership
2. **Agent Economics:** Agents prioritize volume over completion
3. **User Experience:** Mobile app users may be more price-sensitive

### Temporal Patterns:
- Relatively stable cancellation rates across months
- No significant seasonal variation observed
- Day-of-week booking patterns show minor variance
